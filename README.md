# UDEMY COURSE: learning React (hooks, React Router, Redux)

Link of the react course [here](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-the-complete-guide-incl-redux/)

 **Description**
 
 This course is fully up-to-date with the latest version of React and includes React Hooks! 
 
 **What's this course about?**
 
Learn React or dive deeper into it. Learn the theory, solve assignments, practice in demo projects and build one big application which is improved throughout the course: The Burger Builder!

**More details**

JavaScript is the **major driver** of modern web applications since it's the only programming language which runs in the browser and hence allows you to provide highly reactive apps. You'll be able to achieve mobile-app like user experiences in the web.

But using JavaScript **can be challenging** - it quickly becomes overwhelming to create a nice web app with vanilla JavaScript and jQuery only.

**About React!**

**React is all about components** - basically custom HTML elements - with which you can quickly build amazing and powerful web apps. Just build a component once, configure it to your needs, dynamically pass data into it (or listen to your own events!) and re-use it as often as needed.

Need to display a list of users in your app? It's as simple as creating a "User" component and outputting it as often as needed.

This course will **start at the very basics** and explain what exactly React is and how you may use it (and for which kind of apps). Thereafter, we'll go all the way **from basic to advanced**. We'll not just scratch the surface but dive deeply into React as well as popular libraries like react-router and Redux. 

By the end of the course, you can build amazing React (single page) applications!
